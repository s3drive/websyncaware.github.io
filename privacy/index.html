<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use PhotoSync for S3 / Sync for Backblaze B2 (the "App").
</p>

<br>This App doesn't collect or transmit data beyond your media files which are synchronized with your personal S3 compatible account, except:
<br><br>- if QR code authorization (optional) is used, this App will pass the encrypted credentials over "Pusher" service back to web client which rendered the QR code.
<br><br>- if "Open web client" feature (optional) is used, this App will pass one-time encryption key over "Pusher" service back to web client which will then decrypt the encrypted credentials passed in the URI.
<br><br>- in case of an application error, this App may send an error report using "Slack" Webhook API. This allows us to address any potential problems you might be having with this App.
We're logging error message, stack trace, as well as information about your phone model, system and App version that you're using.
<br> You can disable this feature in the Settings screen.
<br><br>- if user decides to use built-in debug log export function, the application logs will be uploaded to "Filestack.com". User has a possibility to review the application logs before uploading.
<br>Uploaded files will be deleted after a period of one month or upon the user request.
<br><br> - if user buys a paid feature there is a connection made to Google Billing API, so the order can be fulfilled. When app starts, there is a connection made to Google Billing API to verify the validity of the purchase and auto-enable paid features.

<br><br>Your media files are uploaded to your personal S3 compatible account and are not shared with any third party.
<br>We're not logging your IP address, device serial number, MAC address, Wi-Fi name or your location.
